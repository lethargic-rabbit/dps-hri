            <h2>Quantum scrambling in a toy model of photodetectors</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Yubao Liu, Haixing Miao, Yanbei Chen, Yiqiu Ma</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum measurement is a process that involves the interaction between a quantum system and a macroscopic measurement apparatus containing many degrees of freedom. The photodetector is such an apparatus with many electrons interacting with the incoming quantum photon. Therefore the incoming photon will spread and get scrambled in the photodetector, that is, the operator of the initial incoming local photons will grow and becomes highly non-local through the interaction process. Investigating this scrambling process in detail is useful for understanding the interaction between the quantum system and the measurement apparatus. In this paper, we study the quantum scrambling process in an effective toy model of photodetectors in three different physical scenarios, by numerically simulating the evolution of the out-of-time correlators (OTOC). In particular, the integrability of the effective model is explored through level spacing statistics, and the effect of the spatially/temporarily distributed disorders on the system evolution is carefully investigated using the OTOC. Looking into these detailed dynamical processes paves the way to the quantum simulation and manipulation of photondetector, which would provide insights into understanding the wave-function collapse processes.</p>

            <h2>Localization control born of intertwined quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quasiperiodic systems are neither randomly disordered nor translationally invariant in the absence of periodic length scales. Based on their incommensurate order, novel physical properties such as critical states and self-similar wavefunctions have been actively discussed. However, in open systems generally described by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, it is hardly known how such quasiperiodic order would lead to new phenomena. In this work, we show for the first time that the intertwined quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity can give rise to striking effects: perfect delocalization of the critical and localized states to the extended states. In particular, we explore the wave function localization character in the Aubry-Andre-Fibonacci (AAF) model where non-reciprocal hopping phases are present. Here, the AAF model continuously interpolates the two different limit between metal to insulator transition and critical states, and the nonHermiticity is encoded in the hopping phase factors. Surprisingly, their interplay results in the perfect delocalization of the states, which is never allowed in quasiperiodic systems with Hermiticity. By quantifying the localization via inverse participation ratio and the fractal dimension, we discuss that the non-Hermitian hopping phase leads to delicate control of localization characteristics of the wave function. Our work offers (1) emergent delocalization transition in quasiperiodic systems via non-Hermitian hopping phase, (2) detailed localization control of the critical states, In addition, we suggest an experimental realization of controllable localized, critical and delocalized states, using photonic crystals.</p>

            <h2>Quantum information scrambling in non-Markovian open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Li-ping Han, Jian Zou, Hai Li, Bin Shao</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper we investigate the dynamics of a spin chain whose two end spins interact with two independent non-Markovian baths by using the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (QSD) equation approach. Specifically two issues about quantum information scrambling in open quantum system are addressed. The first issue is that tripartite mutual information (TMI) can quantify information scrambling properly via its negative value in closed system, whether it is still suitable to indicate quantum scrambling in open quantum system. However we find that negative TMI is not an suitable quantifier of information scrambling in open quantum system in some cases while negative tripartite logarithmic negativity (TLN) is more appropriate. The second one is that up to now almost all the open quantum system effects on information scrambling reported were focus on the Markovian environment, while the effect of non-Markovian environment on information scrambling is still elusive. Significantly our results show that the memory effect of environment will be beneficial to the emergence of quantum information scrambling. Moreover, it is found that environment is generally detrimental for information scrambling in a long time, while in some cases it will be helpful for information scrambling in a short time.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling and operator entanglement in local non-Hermitian quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Brian Barch, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Eleanor Rieffel, and Paolo Zanardi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The breakdown of Lieb-Robinson bounds in local, non-Hermitian quantum systems opens up the possibility for a rich landscape of quantum many-body phenomenology. We elucidate this by studying information scrambling and quantum chaos in non-Hermitian variants of paradigmatic local quantum spin-chain models. We utilize a mixture of exact diagonalization and tensor network techniques for our numerical results and focus on three dynamical quantities: (i) out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), (ii) operator entanglement of the dynamics, and (iii) entanglement growth following a quench from product initial states. We show that while OTOCs fail to capture information scrambling in a simple, local, non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model, the closely related operator entanglement is a robust measure of dynamical properties of interest. Moreover, we show that the short-time growth of operator entanglement can generically detect entanglement phase transitions in these systems while its long-time average is shown to be a reliable indicator of quantum chaos and entanglement phases. This allows us to extend operator entanglement-based diagnostics from previous works on closed and open quantum systems, to the new arena of monitored quantum dynamics. Finally, we remark on the efficacy of these dynamical quantities in detecting integrability/chaos in the presence of continuous monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Superexponential behaviors of out-of-time ordered correlators and Loschmidt echo in a non-Hermitian interacting system</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Wen-Lei Zhao, Jie Liu</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigate, both analytically and numerically, the dynamics of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling under many-body interaction effects via a non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevski map model, incorporating a periodically modulated, complex strength of nonlinear interaction as delta kicks. We establish a theoretical equivalence between a particular out-of-time ordered correlator and the fidelity of a quantum state, which is proportional to the Loschmidt echo. Both exhibit a double exponential growth in relation to time, indicating the emergence of superexponential instability and superexponentially-fast scrambling. The underlying mechanism is rooted in the superexponentially-fast diffusion of energy, arising from the interplay between the positive feedback of nonlinear interaction and the growth of the amplitude of quantum state due to non-Hermiticity. Our findings suggest a kind of fastest divergence of two nearby quantum states, which has implication in information scrambling and brachistochrone evolution of quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum criticality at the boundary of the non-Hermitian regime of a Floquet system</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Wen-Lei Zhao and Jie Liu</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigate both analytically and numerically the dynamics of quantum scrambling, characterized by out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs), in a non-Hermitian quantum kicked rotor subject to quantum resonance conditions. Analytical expressions for OTOCs as a function of time are obtained, demonstrating a sudden transition from linear growth to quadratic growth when the non-Hermitian parameter decays to zero. At this critical point, the rates of the linear growth are found to diverge to infinity, indicating the existence of quantum criticality at the boundary of the non-Hermitian regime. The underlying mechanism of this quantum criticality is uncovered, and possible applications in quantum metrology are discussed.</p>
