            <h2>Scrambling of Quantum Information in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Eiki Iyoda, Takahiro Sagawa</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We systematically investigate scrambling (or delocalizing) processes of quantum information encoded in quantum many-body systems by using numerical exact diagonalization. As a measure of scrambling, we adopt the tripartite mutual information (TMI) that becomes negative when quantum information is delocalized. We clarify that scrambling is an independent property of integrability of Hamiltonians; TMI can be negative or positive for both integrable and non-integrable systems. This implies that scrambling is a separate concept from conventional quantum chaos characterized by non-integrability. Furthermore, we calculate TMI in disordered systems such as many-body localized (MBL) systems and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We find that scrambling occurs but is slow in a MBL phase, while disorder in the SYK model does not make scrambling slower but makes it smoother.</p>

            <h2>Verified Quantum Information Scrambling</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Kevin A. Landsman, Caroline Figgatt, Thomas Schuster, Norbert M. Linke, Beni Yoshida, Norman Y. Yao, Christopher Monroe</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum scrambling is the dispersal of local information into many-body quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout the entire system. This concept underlies the dynamics of thermalization in closed quantum systems, and more recently has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing chaos in black holes. However, the direct experimental measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, since scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence. Here, we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process. This approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit, providing an unambiguous litmus test for scrambling while projecting potential circuit errors into an ancillary observable. We engineer quantum scrambling processes through a tunable 3-qubit unitary operation as part of a 7-qubit circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities are typically ∼80%, and enable us to experimentally bound the scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling in random unitary circuits: Exact results</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Bruno Bertini and Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the scrambling of quantum information in local random unitary circuits by focusing on the tripartite information proposed by Hosur et al. We provide exact results for the averaged Rényi-2 tripartite information in two cases: (i) the local gates are Haar random and (ii) the local gates are dual-unitary and randomly sampled from a single-site Haar-invariant measure. We show that the latter case defines a one-parameter family of circuits, and prove that for a “maximally chaotic” subset of this family quantum information is scrambled faster than in the Haar-random case. Our approach is based on a standard mapping onto an averaged folded tensor network, that can be studied by means of appropriate recurrence relations. By means of the same method, we also revisit the computation of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions, rederiving known formulas for Haar-random unitary circuits, and presenting an exact result for maximally chaotic random dual-unitary gates.</p>

            <h2>Quantum information scrambling in the presence of weak and strong thermalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Zheng-Hang Sun, Jian Cui, and Heng Fan</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum information scrambling under the dynamics of a closed many-body system is of wide interest. The tripartite mutual information (TMI) can quantify the scrambling via its stable negative value under temporal evolution. Here, we study the quench dynamics of the TMI in a nonintegrable Ising model with different initial states in the regimes of strong and weak thermalization. Our numerical results show that the most efficient scrambling can occur when the inverse temperatures of initial states are near zero and in the regime of strong thermalization, and weak thermalization accompanies slow scrambling. We then present an experimental protocol for observing strong and weak thermalization in a one-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, based on which the relation between scrambling and the degree of thermalization revealed in this work can be directly verified by superconducting quantum simulators. The inevitable decoherence effects in real situations are also analyzed, paving the way for faithful quantum simulations on actual experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum steering as a witness of quantum scrambling</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jhen-Dong Lin, Wei-Yu Lin, Huan-Yu Ku, Neill Lambert, Yueh-Nan Chen, and Franco Nori</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum information scrambling describes the delocalization of local information to global information in the form of entanglement throughout all possible degrees of freedom. A natural measure of scrambling is the tripartite mutual information, which quantifies the amount of delocalized information for a given quantum channel with its state representation, i.e., the Choi state. In this work, we show that quantum information scrambling can also be witnessed by temporal quantum steering for qubit systems. We can do so because there is a fundamental equivalence between the Choi state and the pseudodensity matrix formalism used in temporal quantum correlations. In particular, we propose a quantity as a scrambling witness, based on a measure of temporal steering called temporal steerable weight. We justify the scrambling witness for unitary qubit channels by proving that the quantity vanishes whenever the channel is nonscrambling.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling and quantum chaos indicators from long-time properties of operator distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Sivaprasad Omanakuttan, Karthik Chinni, Philip Daniel Blocher, and Pablo M. Poggi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scrambling is a key concept in the analysis of nonequilibrium properties of quantum many-body systems. Most studies focus on its characterization via out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) functions, particularly through the early-time decay of the OTOC. However, scrambling is a complex process which involves operator spreading and operator entanglement, and a full characterization requires one to access more refined information on the operator dynamics at several timescales. In this work we analyze operator scrambling by expanding the target operator in a complete basis and studying the structure of the expansion coefficients treated as a coarse-grained probability distribution in the space of operators. We study different features of this distribution, such as its mean, variance, and participation ratio, for the Ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields, kicked collective spin models, and random circuit models. We show that the long-time properties of the operator distribution display common features across these cases and discuss how these properties can be used as a proxy for the onset of quantum chaos. Finally, we discuss the connection with OTOCs and analyze the cost of probing the operator distribution experimentally using these correlation functions.</p>

            <h2>Information Scrambling in Computationally Complex Quantum Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Xiao Mi and others </p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Interaction in quantum systems can spread initially localized quantum information into the many degrees of freedom of the entire system. Understanding this process, known as quantum scrambling, is the key to resolving various conundrums in physics. Here, by measuring the time-dependent evolution and fluctuation of out-of-time-order correlators, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of quantum scrambling on a 53-qubit quantum processor. We engineer quantum circuits that distinguish the two mechanisms associated with quantum scrambling, operator spreading and operator entanglement, and experimentally observe their respective signatures. We show that while operator spreading is captured by an efficient classical model, operator entanglement requires exponentially scaled computational resources to simulate. These results open the path to studying complex and practically relevant physical observables with near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Proposal for measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators at finite temperature with coupled spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Bhuvanesh Sundar, Andreas Elben, Lata Kh Joshi and Torsten V Zache</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Information scrambling, which is the spread of local information through a system's many-body degrees of freedom, is an intrinsic feature of many-body dynamics. In quantum systems, the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling. Motivated by experiments that have measured the OTOC at infinite temperature and a theory proposal to measure the OTOC at finite temperature using the thermofield double state, we describe a protocol to measure the OTOC in a finite temperature spin chain that is realized approximately as one half of the ground state of two moderately-sized coupled spin chains. We consider a spin Hamiltonian with particle–hole symmetry, for which we show that the OTOC can be measured without needing sign-reversal of the Hamiltonian. We describe a protocol to mitigate errors in the estimated OTOC, arising from the finite approximation of the system to the thermofield double state. We show that our protocol is also robust to main sources of decoherence in experiments.</p>

            <h2>Information scrambling in chaotic systems with dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Yong-Liang Zhang, Yichen Huang, and Xie Chen</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chaotic dynamics in closed local quantum systems scrambles quantum information, which is manifested quantitatively in the decay of the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) of local operators. How is information scrambling affected when the system is coupled to the environment and suffers from dissipation? In this paper, we address this question by defining a dissipative version of OTOC and numerically study its behavior in a prototypical chaotic quantum chain in the presence of dissipation. We find that dissipation leads to not only the overall decay of the scrambled information due to leaking but also structural changes so that the ‘information light cone’ can only reach a finite distance even when the effect of overall decay is removed. Based on this observation we conjecture a modified version of the Lieb-Robinson bound in dissipative systems.</p>

            <h2>Unifying scrambling, thermalization and entanglement through measurement of fidelity out-of-time-order correlators in the Dicke model</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> R. J. Lewis-Swan, A. Safavi-Naini, J. J. Bollinger & A. M. Rey</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scrambling is the process by which information stored in local degrees of freedom spreads over the many-body degrees of freedom of a quantum system, becoming inaccessible to local probes and apparently lost. Scrambling and entanglement can reconcile seemingly unrelated behaviors including thermalization of isolated quantum systems and information loss in black holes. Here, we demonstrate that fidelity out-of-time-order correlators (FOTOCs) can elucidate connections between scrambling, entanglement, ergodicity and quantum chaos (butterfly effect). We compute FOTOCs for the paradigmatic Dicke model, and show they can measure subsystem Rényi entropies and inform about quantum thermalization. Moreover, we illustrate why FOTOCs give access to a simple relation between quantum and classical Lyapunov exponents in a chaotic system without finite-size effects. Our results open a path to experimental use FOTOCs to explore scrambling, bounds on quantum information processing and investigation of black hole analogs in controllable quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Locality, Quantum Fluctuations, and Scrambling</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Shenglong Xu and Brian Swingle</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Thermalization of chaotic quantum many-body systems under unitary time evolution is related to the growth in complexity of initially simple Heisenberg operators. Operator growth is a manifestation of information scrambling and can be diagnosed by out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). However, the behavior of OTOCs of local operators in generic chaotic local Hamiltonians remains poorly understood, with some semiclassical and large-N models exhibiting exponential growth of OTOCs and a sharp chaos wave front and other random circuit models showing a diffusively broadened wave front. In this paper, we propose a unified physical picture for scrambling in chaotic local Hamiltonians. We construct a random time-dependent Hamiltonian model featuring a large-N limit where the OTOC obeys a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type equation and exhibits exponential growth and a sharp wave front. We show that quantum fluctuations manifest as noise (distinct from the randomness of the couplings in the underlying Hamiltonian) in the FKPP equation and that the noise-averaged OTOC exhibits a crossover to a diffusively broadened wave front. At small N, we demonstrate that operator growth dynamics, averaged over the random couplings, can be efficiently simulated for all time using matrix product state techniques. To show that time-dependent randomness is not essential to our conclusions, we push our previous matrix product operator methods to very large size and show that data for a time-independent Hamiltonian model are also consistent with a diffusively broadened wave front.</p>

            <h2>Information scrambling and chaos in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Paolo Zanardi and Namit Anand</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have been extensively used over the past few years to study information scrambling and quantum chaos in many-body systems. In this paper, we extend the formalism of the averaged bipartite OTOC of Styliaris et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 030601 (2021)] to the case of open quantum systems. The dynamics is no longer unitary but it is described by more general quantum channels (trace preserving, completely positive maps). This “open bipartite OTOC” can be treated in an exact analytical fashion and is shown to amount to a distance between two quantum channels. Moreover, our analytical form unveils competing entropic contributions from information scrambling and environmental decoherence such that the latter can obfuscate the former. To elucidate this subtle interplay, we analytically study special classes of quantum channels, namely, dephasing channels, entanglement-breaking channels, and others. Finally, as a physical application we numerically study dissipative many-body spin chains and show how the competing entropic effects can be used to differentiate between integrable and chaotic regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We provide a general protocol to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions. These correlation functions are of broad theoretical interest for diagnosing the scrambling of quantum information in interacting quantum systems and have recently received particular attention in the study of chaos and black holes within holographic duality. Measuring them requires an echo-type sequence in which the sign of a many-body Hamiltonian is reversed. We illustrate our protocol by detailing an implementation employing cold atoms and cavity quantum electrodynamics to probe spin models with nonlocal interactions. To verify the feasibility of the scheme with current technology, we analyze the effects of dissipation in a chaotic kicked-top model. Finally, we propose a number of other experimental platforms where similar out-of-time-order correlation functions can be measured.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work we study the effect of static disorder on the growth of commutators—a probe of information scrambling in quantum many-body systems—in a variety of contexts. We find generically that disorder slows the onset of scrambling and, in the case of a many-body localized (MBL) state, partially halts it. In the MBL state, we show using a fixed point Hamiltonian that operators exhibit slow logarithmic growth under time evolution and compare the result with the expected growth of commutators in (de)localized noninteracting disordered models. Finally, using a scaling argument, we state a conjecture on the growth of commutators in a weakly interacting diffusive metal.</p>

Here we use a particular Majorana fermion representation of spin-1/2 systems to study quantum chaos in the Dicke model. We take the system to be in thermal equilibrium and compute λL throughout the phase diagram to leading order in 1/N . We find that the chaotic behavior is strongest close to the critical point. At high temperatures λL is nonzero over an extended region that includes both the normal and superradiant phases. At low temperatures λL is nonzero in (a) close vicinity of the critical point and (b) a region within the superradiant phase. In the process we also derive an effective theory for the superradiant phase at finite temperatures. Our formalism does not rely on the assumption of total spin conservation.</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Chi-Fang Chen and Andrew Lucas</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In a locally interacting many-body system, two isolated qubits, separated by a large distance r, become correlated and entangled with each other at a time t≥r/v. This finite speed v of quantum information scrambling limits quantum information processing, thermalization, and even equilibrium correlations. Yet most experimental systems contain long range power-law interactions—qubits separated by r have potential energy V(r)∝ r^(−α). Examples include the long range Coulomb interactions in plasma (α=1) and dipolar interactions between spins (α=3). In one spatial dimension, we prove that the speed of quantum scrambling remains finite for sufficiently large α. This result parametrically improves previous bounds, compares favorably with recent numerical simulations, and can be realized in quantum simulators with dipolar interactions. Our new mathematical methods lead to improved algorithms for classically simulating quantum systems, and improve bounds on environmental decoherence in experimental quantum information processors.</p>

            <h2>Notes on scrambling in conformal field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Chang Liu and David A. Lowe</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The onset of quantum chaos in quantum field theory may be studied using out-of-time-order correlators at finite temperature. Recent work argued that a time scale logarithmic in the central charge emerged in the context of two-dimensional conformal field theories, provided the intermediate channel was dominated by the Virasoro identity block. This suggests a wide class of conformal field theories that exhibit a version of fast scrambling. In the present work we study this idea in more detail. We begin by clarifying to what extent correlators of wave packets built out of superpositions of primary operators may be used to quantify quantum scrambling. Subject to certain caveats, these results concur with previous work. We then go on to study the contribution of intermediate states beyond the Virasoro identity block. We find that at late times, time-ordered correlators exhibit a familiar decoupling theorem, suppressing the contribution of higher dimension operators. However this is no longer true of the out-of-time-order correlators relevant for the discussion of quantum chaos. We compute the contributions of these conformal blocks to the relevant correlators and find they are able to dominate in many interesting limits. Interpreting these results in the context of holographic models of quantum gravity, sheds new light on the black hole information problem by exhibiting a class of correlators where bulk effective field theory does not predict its own demise.</p>

            <h2>Quantum scrambling via accessible tripartite information</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Gabriele Lo Monaco, Luca Innocenti, Dario Cilluffo, Diana A Chisholm, Salvatore Lorenzo, G Massimo Palma</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum information scrambling (QIS), from the perspective of quantum information theory, is generally understood as local non-retrievability of information evolved through some dynamical process, and is often quantified via entropic quantities such as the tripartite information. We argue that this approach comes with a number of issues, in large part due to its reliance on quantum mutual informations, which do not faithfully quantify correlations directly retrievable via measurements, and in part due to the specific methodology used to compute tripartite informations of the studied dynamics. We show that these issues can be overcome by using accessible mutual informations, defining corresponding 'accessible tripartite informations', and provide explicit examples of dynamics whose scrambling properties are not properly quantified by the standard tripartite information. Our results lay the groundwork for a more profound understanding of what QIS represents, and reveal a number of promising, as of yet unexplored, venues for further research.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling and Quantum Teleportation</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> MuSeong Kim, Mi-Ra Hwang, Eylee Jung, DaeKil Park</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scrambling is a concept introduced from information loss problem arising in black hole. In this paper we discuss the effect of scrambling from a perspective of pure quantum information theory. We introduce 7-qubit quantum circuit for a quantum teleportation. It is shown that the teleportation can be perfect if a maximal scrambling unitary is used. From this fact we conjecture that ``the quantity of scrambling is proportional to the fidelity of teleportation''. In order to confirm the conjecture we introduce θ-dependent partially scrambling unitary, which reduces to no scrambling and maximal scrambling at θ=0 and θ=π/2, respectively. Then, we compute the average fidelity analytically, and numerically by making use of qiskit (version 0.36.2) and 7-qibit real quantum computer ibm_oslo. Finally, we conclude that our conjecture can be true or false depending on the choice of qubits for Bell measurement.</p>

            <h2>Out-of-time-ordered correlator in non-Hermitian quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Liang-Jun Zhai and Shuai Yin</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the behavior of the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) in a non-Hermitian quantum Ising system. We show that the OTOC can diagnose not only the exceptional point in the states with lowest real parts of Hamiltonian spectra (LRHS), which host the Yang-Lee edge singularity, but also the exceptional point in states with higher real parts of Hamiltonian spectra (HRHS). We find that the evolution of the OTOC in the parity-time symmetric phase can be divided into two stages: In the short-time stage, the OTOC oscillates periodically, and when the parameter is near the exceptional point of the LRHS, this oscillation behavior can be described by both the scaling theory of the zero-dimensional (0D) quantum Yang-Lee edge singularity and the scaling theory of the 1D
 quantum Ising model, while in the long-time stage the OTOC increases exponentially, controlled by the exceptional point of the HRHS. Possible experimental realizations are then discussed.</p>
