            <h2>Entanglement of quantum evolutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Paolo Zanardi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The notion of entanglement can be naturally extended from quantum states to the level of general quantum evolutions. This is achieved by considering multipartite unitary transformations as elements of a multipartite Hilbert space and then extended to general quantum operations. We show some connection between this entanglement and the entangling capabilities of the quantum evolution.</p>

            <h2>Scrambling and operator entanglement in local non-Hermitian quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Brian Barch, Namit Anand, Jeffrey Marshall, Eleanor Rieffel, and Paolo Zanardi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The breakdown of Lieb-Robinson bounds in local, non-Hermitian quantum systems opens up the possibility for a rich landscape of quantum many-body phenomenology. We elucidate this by studying information scrambling and quantum chaos in non-Hermitian variants of paradigmatic local quantum spin-chain models. We utilize a mixture of exact diagonalization and tensor network techniques for our numerical results and focus on three dynamical quantities: (i) out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), (ii) operator entanglement of the dynamics, and (iii) entanglement growth following a quench from product initial states. We show that while OTOCs fail to capture information scrambling in a simple, local, non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model, the closely related operator entanglement is a robust measure of dynamical properties of interest. Moreover, we show that the short-time growth of operator entanglement can generically detect entanglement phase transitions in these systems while its long-time average is shown to be a reliable indicator of quantum chaos and entanglement phases. This allows us to extend operator entanglement-based diagnostics from previous works on closed and open quantum systems, to the new arena of monitored quantum dynamics. Finally, we remark on the efficacy of these dynamical quantities in detecting integrability/chaos in the presence of continuous monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Entangling power and operator entanglement of nonunitary quantum evolutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Fan-Zhen Kong, Jun-Long Zhao, Ming Yang, and Zhuo-Liang Cao</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We propose a method to calculate the operator entanglement and entangling power of a noisy nonunitary operation in terms of linear entropy. By decomposing the Kraus operators of noisy evolution as the sum of products of Pauli matrices, we derive the analytical expression of the operator entanglement for a general nonunitary operation. The definition of entangling power is extended from the ideal unitary operation case to the nonunitary case via a Kraus operator representation and the analytical expression of the entangling power for a general nonunitary operation is derived. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the above method, we investigate the properties of operator entanglement and entangling power of nonunitary operations caused by phase damping noise. Our findings imply that the pure phase damping noise has its own operator entanglement and entangling power, which increase exponentially with time and asymptotically approach their respective upper bounds. In addition, when the phase damping noise is added to an ideal operation, such as an iswap operation or a controlled-Z operation, it can make the operation's entangling power grow exponentially with the strength of noise, but leave its operator entanglement invariant. In this sense, we can conclude that, for a general operation, operator entanglement is a more intrinsic property than entangling power.</p>

            <h2>Barrier from chaos: operator entanglement dynamics of the reduced density matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Huajia Wang & Tianci Zhou </p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is believed that thermalization drives the reduced density matrix of a sub- system to approach a short-range entangled operator. If the initial state is also short-range entangled, it is possible that the reduced density matrix remains low-entangled throughout thermalization; or there could exist a barrier with high operator entanglement between the initial and thermalized reduced density matrix. In this paper, we study such dynamics in three classes of models: the rational CFTs, the random unitary circuit, and the holographic CFTs, representing systems of increasing quantum chaoticity. We show that in all three classes of models, the operator entanglement (or variant of ) exhibits three phases, a linear growth phase, a plateau phase, and a decay phase. The plateau phase characterized by volume-law operator entanglement corresponds to the barrier in operator entanglement. While it is present in all three models, its persistence and exit show interesting distinc- tions among them. The rational CFTs have the shortest plateau phase, followed by the slowest decay phase; the holographic CFTs mark the opposite end, i.e. having the longest plateau phase followed by a discontinuous drop; and the random unitary circuit shows the intermediate behavior. We discuss the mechanisms underlying these behaviors in opera- tor entanglement barriers, whose persistence might serve as another measure for quantum chaoticity.</p>

            <h2>Information scrambling versus quantum revival through the lens of operator entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Kanato Goto, Ali Mollabashi, Masahiro Nozaki, Kotaro Tamaoka & Mao Tian Tan </p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we look for signatures of quantum revivals in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs) on a spatially compact manifold by using operator entanglement. It is believed that thermalization does not occur on spatially compact manifolds as the quantum state returns to its initial state which is a phenomenon known as quantum revival. We find that in CFTs such as the free fermion CFT, the operator mutual information exhibits quantum revival in accordance with the relativistic propagation of quasiparticles while in holographic CFTs, the operator mutual information does not exhibit this revival and the quasiparticle picture breaks down. Furthermore, by computing the tripartite operator mutual information, we find that the information scrambling ability of holographic CFTs can be weakened by the finite size effect. We propose a modification of an effective model known as the line tension picture to explain the entanglement dynamics due to the strong scrambling effect and find a close relationship between this model and the wormhole (Einstein-Rosen Bridge) in the holographic bulk dual.</p>

            <h2>More on symmetry resolved operator entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Sara Murciano Jérôme Dubai and Pasquale Calabrese</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 'operator entanglement' of a quantum operator O is a useful indicator of its complexity, and, in one-dimension, of its approximability by matrix product operators. Here we focus on spin chains with a global U(1) conservation law, and on operators O with a well-defined U(1) charge, for which it is possible to resolve the operator entanglement of O according to the U(1) symmetry. We employ the notion of symmetry resolved operator entanglement (SROE) introduced in Rath et al (2023 PRX Quantum4 010318) and extend the results of the latter paper in several directions. Using a combination of conformal field theory and of exact analytical and numerical calculations in critical free fermionic chains, we study the SROE of the thermal density matrix  and of charged local operators evolving in Heisenberg picture . Our main results are: i) the SROE of  obeys the operator area law; ii) for free fermions, local operators in Heisenberg picture can have a SROE that grows logarithmically in time or saturates to a constant value; iii) there is equipartition of the entanglement among all the charge sectors except for a pair of fermionic creation and annihilation operators.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion and operator entanglement spreading</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the spreading of the operator space entanglement entropy (OSEE) is key in order to explore out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. Here we argue that for integrable models the dynamics of the OSEE is related to the diffusion of the operator front. We derive the logarithmic bound

)
 for the OSEE of some simple, i.e., low-rank, diagonal local operators. We numerically check that the bound is saturated in the rule 54 chain, which is representative of interacting integrable systems. Remarkably, the same bound is saturated in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg 
X

Z
 chain. Away from the isotropic point and from the free-fermion point, the OSEE grows as

)
, irrespective of the chain anisotropy, suggesting universality. Finally, we discuss the effect of integrability breaking. We show that strong finite-time effects are present, which prevent us from probing the asymptotic behavior of the OSEE.</p>

            <h2>Operator entanglement entropy of the time evolution operator in chaotic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tianci Zhou and David J. Luitz</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the growth of the operator entanglement entropy (EE) of the time evolution operator in chaotic, many-body localized (MBL) and Floquet systems. In the random-field Heisenberg model we find a universal power-law growth of the operator EE at weak disorder, a logarithmic growth at strong disorder, and extensive saturation values in both cases. In a Floquet spin model, the saturation value after an initial linear growth is identical to the value of a random unitary operator (the Page value). We understand these properties by mapping the operator EE to a global quench problem evolved with a similar parent Hamiltonian in an enlarged Hilbert space with the same chaotic, MBL, and Floquet properties as the original Hamiltonian. The scaling and saturation properties reflect the spreading of the state EE of the corresponding time evolution. We conclude that the EE of the evolution operator should characterize the propagation of information in these systems.</p>

            <h2>Operator entanglement in local quantum circuits I: Chaotic dual-unitary circuits
</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Bruno Bertini, Pavel Kos and Tomaz Prosen</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The entanglement in operator space is a well established measure for the complexity of quantum many-body dynamics. In particular, that of local operators has recentlybeen proposed as dynamical chaos indicator, i.e. as a quantity able to discriminate between quantum systems with integrable and chaotic dynamics. For chaotic systems thelocal-operator entanglement is expected to grow linearly in time, while it is expected togrow at most logarithmically in the integrable case. Here we study the dynamics of localoperator entanglement in dual-unitary quantum circuits, a class of “statistically solvable"quantum circuits that we recently introduced. We identify a class of “completely chaotic"dual-unitary circuits where the local-operator entanglement grows linearly and we provide a conjecture for its asymptotic behaviour which is in excellent agreement with thenumerical results. Interestingly, our conjecture also predicts a “phase transition" in theslope of the local-operator entanglement when varying the parameters of the circuits.</p>

            <h2>Local operator entanglement in spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Eric Mascot, Masahiro Nozaki and Masaki Tezuka</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how and whether local perturbations can affect the entire quantum system is a fundamental step in understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as thermalization. This knowledge of non-equilibrium phenomena is applicable for quantum
computation, as many quantum computers employ non-equilibrium processes for computations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of bi- and tripartite operator mutual information of the time-evolution operator and the Pauli spin operators in the onedimensional Ising model with magnetic field and the disordered Heisenberg model to
study the properties of quantum circuits. In the Ising model, the early-time evolution
qualitatively follows an effective light cone picture, and the late-time value is well described by Page’s value for a random pure state. In the Heisenberg model with strong
disorder, we find that many-body localization prevents the information from propagating and being delocalized. We also find an effective Ising Hamiltonian that describes
the time evolution of bi- and tripartite operator mutual information for the Heisenberg
model in the large disorder regime</p>
